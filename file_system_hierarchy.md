## /usr - User Binaries and Data
Secondary hierarchy containing user binaries, libraries, documentation, and source code.

### /usr/bin - User Binaries

### /usr/sbin - System Administration Binaries
Non-vital system administration binaries.

### /usr/lib - Libraries
Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

### /usr/include - C Header Files
Header files for C programming.

### /usr/share - Shared Data
Architecture-independent data shared among applications.

## /home - Home Directories
User home directories containing personal files and settings.

## /root - Root Home Directory

## /lib - Essential Shared Libraries
Essential shared libraries required for system boot.

## /opt - Optional Software
Additional software packages installed by the system administrator.

## /mnt - Mount Points
Temporary mount points for mounting external filesystems.

## /media - Removable Media Mount Points
Mount points for removable media such as USB drives and DVDs.

## /srv - Service Data
Data for services provided by the system.

## /run - Runtime Data
Runtime data for processes started since the last boot.

## /tmp - Temporary Files
System-wide temporary files that may be deleted between reboots.

## /lost+found - Recovered Files
Recovered files after a system crash, stored by the fsck utility.

## /usr/local - Locally Installed Software
Locally installed software by the system administrator outside the package management system.

## /etc/sysconfig - System Configuration Files
System-specific configuration files that control various services and settings.

## /etc/network - Network Configuration Files
Network-related configuration files, including interface configurations and routing tables.

## /etc/security - Security Configuration Files
Configuration files related to system security and access controls.

## /etc/init.d - Init Scripts
Init scripts for various services, executed during system startup and shutdown.

## /var/log - Log Files
System log files that record events and errors.

### /var/spool/cron - Cron Jobs
Scheduled tasks managed by the cron daemon.

## /var/run - Runtime Information
Runtime information about the system since the last boot.

## /var/lock - Lock Files
Lock files used by various applications to prevent multiple instances or data corruption.

## /var/lib - Variable State Information
Variable state information for programs, including databases and persistent data.

### /var/lib/mysql - MySQL Database Files
MySQL database files.

### /var/lib/pgsql - PostgreSQL Database Files
PostgreSQL database files.

## /var/www - Web Server Files
Default directory for the web server, containing website data.

## /opt - Optional Add-on Applications
